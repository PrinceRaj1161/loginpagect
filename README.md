# Simple Login Page

This repository contains a simple login page built using **HTML** and **CSS** with the sole use of **Flexbox** for layout styling. The design is clean, responsive, and minimal, making it a great starting point for learning Flexbox or building upon for more complex projects.

## Features
- Fully responsive layout using Flexbox.
- Clean and minimal design.
- Easy to customize and extend.

## Folder Structure
```
├── index.html  # The main HTML file
├── styles.css  # CSS file containing the Flexbox-based styling
└── README.md   # Documentation file
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To view and edit this project, you will need:
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/princeraj1161/loginpagect.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loginpagect
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## How It Works
- The layout is built entirely using Flexbox, with a parent container centering the login form both vertically and horizontally.
- The CSS styles are kept minimal, focusing solely on Flexbox properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.
